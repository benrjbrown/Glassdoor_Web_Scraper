# Glassdoor_Web_Scraper
An ongoing project which uses a web scraper build for career webside 'glassdoor.com'.
The initial goal was to summarize the key factors correlated with salary for positions in the field of data science, however, now that the code infestructure is built I plan on expanding it's reach to other budding careers in tech and track changes in employee satisfaction over time.
